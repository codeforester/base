# Base Architecture

Status: maintained architecture reference
Last reviewed: 2026-07-25

## Overview

Base is an opinionated macOS-primary implementation of a local operating
contract for independent Git repositories. It provides the inventory,
readiness, trust, onboarding, and handoff evidence needed to operate that repo
set through one CLI interface. The current implementation support contract
covers macOS plus narrow Ubuntu/Debian source-checkout runtime and apt-backed
setup paths. Broader Linux distribution support, WSL, and Windows are not in
scope today.

The governing philosophy: **solve your own problem elegantly first**. Base is
built for a specific workflow: multiple peer Git repositories under a shared
parent directory, each declaring their dependencies through a simple manifest,
all managed through a unified interface. GitHub is the first-class forge
automation target today. Non-GitHub Git repositories can still use Base's local
project loop after they exist locally, but GitHub workflow automation remains
GitHub-specific. The exact contract lives in
[Source Control And Forge Support](source-control-and-forge-support.md).

---

## Product Direction

Base's long-term product shape is a local operating contract for deterministic
readiness and handoff across independent Git repositories. It should make a
folder of sibling repositories understandable, locally ready, explicitly
trusted, easy to onboard, and transferable without becoming a replacement for
Homebrew, `mise`, Docker, GitHub CLI, IDEs, agent runtimes, or project-owned
build systems.

The coherent product loop is:

```text
inventory -> prepare -> verify -> trust -> onboard -> hand off
```

Here, deterministic means explicit inspection order, stable findings or
machine-readable structures, and clear next actions from declared inputs and
observable local state. It does not mean hermetic builds, byte-for-byte
environments, or transactional multi-repository mutation.

The product responsibility tiers are:

1. The core outcome: deterministic local readiness and handoff.
2. The enabling execution contract: `base_manifest.yaml`, `basectl`,
   `base-wrapper`, activation, and declared project commands.
3. Supporting workflow packs: repository baselines plus GitHub and release
   conventions.
4. Adapters: environment managers, IDEs, containers, Nix/devenv, and AI tools.

These are architecture responsibility tiers, not separately installed
packages. Major features should strengthen the outcome loop. A command does not
become core merely because `basectl` dispatches it.

---

## Core Principles

- **Opinionated over flexible** — Base makes decisions for you. Fewer choices means
  less complexity and easier maintenance. If you disagree with the decisions, use a
  different tool.
- **Problem-first** — technology choices follow real problems encountered during
  development, not the other way around.
- **Ship incrementally** — start minimal, use it yourself, let the tool grow organically
  through real use.
- **Idempotent by design** — running any setup command multiple times should produce
  the same result safely.
- **Orchestrate, do not replace** — Base should discover, sequence, validate,
  and explain mature tools rather than absorb their full configuration models.
- **Observable and diagnosable** — Base commands should make local state and
  failures understandable through clear output, stable finding IDs, JSON where
  useful, and inspectable logs.

---

## Repository Structure

Base is a public GitHub repository. The primary dogfood workspace is a set of
GitHub repositories checked out as peers under a shared parent directory:

```
~/work/              ← shared workspace root
  base/              ← the Base repository itself
  myproject-a/       ← peer project with base_manifest.yaml
  myproject-b/       ← peer project with base_manifest.yaml
  banyanlabs/        ← peer project with base_manifest.yaml
```

Base discovers peer repositories by scanning the workspace root for Git
repositories that contain `base_manifest.yaml`. The local project loop does not
require the remote to be hosted on GitHub. Repository creation, configuration,
issue, pull-request, Project, and release automation do require GitHub today.

---

## Shell Support

Base supports two shells:

- **bash** — primary scripting shell. All orchestration scripts run in bash. Default for
  all base internals.
- **zsh** — supported for interactive use. Power users who prefer zsh for their
  interactive shell are accommodated.

Fish, tcsh, ksh, and other shells are explicitly out of scope for now. If real demand
emerges, support can be added later.

---

## Command Surface — `basectl` as Control Plane

The most important command-surface decision in Base: **the product is Base, the
control-plane command is `basectl`**.

`basectl` is the public entrypoint. It is a normal executable command that
establishes the Base runtime before dispatching to Bash scripts or future Python
layers. This keeps the product name and the control-plane action separate:

- `basectl setup`
- `basectl check`
- `basectl doctor`
- `basectl update-profile`
- `basectl projects list`
- `basectl workspace status`
- `basectl activate`
- `basectl run`
- `basectl test`
- `basectl build`
- `basectl demo`
- `basectl release`
- `basectl logs`

Shebang-based Bash scripts can also use:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env basectl
```

In that mode, `basectl` wraps the script in the Base environment, sources it,
and calls its `main` function.

The current dispatch and runtime contract is documented in
[execution-model.md](execution-model.md).

---

## Project Activation Model — Subshell Design

### Why Subshells

Activating a project environment means setting shell variables, aliases, functions, and
activating a Python virtual environment. The naive approach of activate/deactivate
(like Python venv) does not scale to the full richness of a shell environment. Tracking
and restoring arbitrary shell state on deactivation is complex and error-prone.

The solution: **spawn a Bash runtime shell** when activating a project. The
project environment lives inside that shell. The user works in that shell. When
done, they `exit` (or Ctrl-D) and return to their base shell. No deactivation
logic required. No state restoration complexity.

This does not require a distinct shell function. A normal `basectl activate <project>`
command can validate the target and launch the Bash runtime shell.

### Activation Flow

```
basectl activate myproject
  ↓
1. Look up BASE_HOME, resolve the workspace root, and scan known projects
2. Validate myproject exists and has a valid manifest
3. Set BASE_PROJECT=myproject
4. Spawn a new Bash runtime shell
5. In that shell: load the Base runtime and user Bash startup with guardrails
6. In that shell: activate the project's Python virtual environment
7. In that shell: source manifest-declared activate.source scripts
8. Update the prompt to reflect the active project
9. User works in the Bash runtime shell
10. User exits → returns to base shell, prompt resets
```

### `basectl activate` — Intelligence

- Takes a project name as argument (not a directory path)
- Works from any current directory — the user does not need to be in the project folder
- Base locates projects from explicit `--workspace`, configured `workspace.root`,
  or the parent of `$BASE_HOME` as a source-checkout fallback
- Validates that the target is a recognized Base project with a valid manifest

---

## Shell Environment Layers

Base separates ordinary shell startup from Base runtime activation.
These shell environment layers are distinct from the product responsibility
tiers above; their numbering is local to shell startup and runtime state.

### Shell Layer 1 — Dotfile Integration

Applied by the user's normal Bash/Zsh startup files after running
`basectl update-profile`.

Contains:
- login-shell handoff for Bash (`~/.bash_profile` sources `~/.bashrc` with guardrails)
- interactive Bash/Zsh guardrails
- `BASE_HOME` derived from the sourced Base snippet
- Base `bin/` added to `PATH` so `basectl` is available after login
- optional sibling `base-platform-tools/bin` added to `PATH` when present
- optional shell defaults when the user runs `basectl update-profile --defaults`

This layer must not source `base_init.sh` and must not establish the full Base
runtime contract. It is only about Bash/Zsh startup behavior plus launcher
availability.

### Shell Layer 2 — Base Runtime Environment

Applied when the user invokes `basectl`, `basectl activate <project>`, or
`basectl /path/to/script.sh`. Invoking `basectl` with no arguments in a terminal
starts the Base project runtime while preserving the caller's current
directory.

Contains:
- exported Base path contract such as `BASE_HOME`, `BASE_BIN_DIR`,
  `BASE_BASH_LIB_DIR`, `BASE_BASH_LIBS_DIR`, and `BASE_BASH_LIBS_SOURCE`
- OS and host metadata such as `BASE_OS`, `BASE_PLATFORM`, `BASE_HOST_ENV`, and `BASE_HOST`
- Base's Bash standard library
- `import_base_lib` for convention-based Base Bash library imports from the
  resolved reusable Bash library root
- PATH additions for Base's own executable entrypoints
- optional PATH additions for the local Base Platform Tools companion repo

This layer is established by `base_init.sh`, which is sourced only through the
`basectl` command path. The canonical variable reference and mutability policy
live in [Runtime Environment](runtime-environment.md). The standalone
`base-bash-libs` install path and post-migration contract live in
[Base Bash Libraries](base-bash-libs.md).

### Shell Layer 3 — Project-Specific Environment

Applied inside the project subshell when `basectl activate <project>` is run.

Contains:
- Project-specific PATH additions
- Project-specific environment variables
- Project-specific aliases and functions
- Project-specific Python virtual environment activation
- Manifest-declared `activate.source` scripts
- `BASE_PROJECT` updated to the project name

Project-specific settings layer on top of the Base runtime environment. Settings
not overridden by the project inherit from Base. When the subshell exits, the
project layer disappears naturally — no explicit deactivation needed.

### Dotfile Management

Base updates the user's real dotfiles by managing small marked sections. The preferred adoption model is:

```bash
basectl update-profile
```

By default, Base updates all four files:

| Dotfile | Base snippet | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.bash_profile` | `lib/shell/bash_profile` | Login Bash bridge into `~/.bashrc` |
| `~/.bashrc` | `lib/shell/bashrc` | Interactive Bash startup |
| `~/.zprofile` | `lib/shell/zprofile` | Thin Zsh login startup |
| `~/.zshrc` | `lib/shell/zshrc` | Interactive Zsh startup |

Base does not symlink over the user's dotfiles and does not own content outside its clearly marked managed sections. The markers are intentionally explicit, for example:

```bash
# >>> base: bashrc managed >>>
# <<< base: bashrc managed <<<
```

Optional Base shell defaults are enabled explicitly with `basectl update-profile --defaults`.

---

## Directory Change Behavior

**Changing directory does not trigger environment changes.**

This is a deliberate design decision. Auto-activating environments on `cd` is confusing
because the intent behind a `cd` is ambiguous — the user may be casually navigating,
not intending to switch project context. Background logic running on every `cd` also
slows the shell and is error-prone.

The only things that change on `cd`:
- `$PWD` updates (built-in shell behavior)
- The directory portion of the prompt updates
- The git branch portion of the prompt updates dynamically (see Prompt section)

Everything else stays stable until the user explicitly runs `basectl activate <project>`.

---

## Prompt Design

The prompt shows three things, always:

```
[myproject: main] ~/projects/myproject/src $
```

| Element | Source | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Project name | `$BASE_PROJECT` | Static — set at activation, stays until subshell exits |
| Git branch | Dynamic query | Updates on every prompt render |
| Current directory | `$PWD` | Updates on every `cd` |

### Project Name in Prompt

`BASE_PROJECT` is set by `basectl activate`. When the user invokes `basectl`
with no arguments in an interactive terminal, Base discovers the nearest
`base_manifest.yaml` above the current directory and activates that project
while preserving the current directory. If no manifest is found, it falls back
to the `base` project.

Once the subshell starts, `BASE_PROJECT` stays fixed until the shell exits. It
does not change dynamically when the user later runs `cd`.

### Git Branch in Prompt

The git branch is **not stored in a variable**. It is queried dynamically each time the
prompt renders. This ensures the prompt reflects reality when the user runs `git
checkout` to switch branches inside the subshell.

Implementation in PS1:

```bash
_base_git_branch() {
  git symbolic-ref --quiet --short HEAD 2>/dev/null ||
    git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null
}

PS1='[${BASE_PROJECT}: $(_base_git_branch)] \w $ '
```

Key decision: the branch is queried from the current directory at prompt render
time. This keeps the prompt honest when a Base runtime shell is started from a
nested project directory or when the user moves between repositories inside the
same shell.

### Why Not Show Python Venv in Prompt

The project name in the prompt implies the Python virtual environment — if a project is
active, its venv is active. Showing both would be redundant. The prompt stays clean.

---

## Python Virtual Environments

### Base Venv

- Created once during `basectl setup`
- Lives at `~/.base.d/base/.venv`
- Used to run Base's own Python orchestration code (manifest parsing, project discovery,
  etc.)
- Not activated in the user's interactive shell by default — it runs internally when
  Base needs it

### Project Venv

- Created per project during `basectl setup <project>` or `basectl setup` when scanning
  all projects
- Lives at `<project-root>/.venv` for non-Base projects by default
- Can be kept at `~/.base.d/<project>/.venv` with `python.venv_location: external`
- Activated automatically when `basectl activate <project>` spawns the project subshell
- Deactivated automatically when the subshell exits

### Key Distinction

Only one Python venv can be active at a time. Base venv runs quietly in the background
for Base's own tools. Project venv is what the user interacts with. The two never
conflict because Base venv is not surfaced in the interactive shell.

---

## Project Manifest

Each Base-managed project declares its dependencies in a YAML manifest file at the
project root. Base reads this manifest to know what to install and configure.

File: `base_manifest.yaml`

Current and planned structure:

```yaml
schema_version: 1

project:
  name: myproject
  languages:
    - python
    - javascript

brewfile: Brewfile

mise: .mise.toml

artifacts:
  - type: python-package
    name: requests
    version: latest

health:
  required_env:
    - DATABASE_URL
    - REDIS_URL
  required_ports:
    - name: postgres
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 5432
      state: listening
    - name: app
      port: 8000
      state: free

activate:
  source:
    - .base/activate.sh

test:
  command: pytest tests/

commands:
  dev: uvicorn app:app --reload
  lint: ruff check .
```

`schema_version` is a manifest compatibility marker. Missing values are treated
as schema version `1`, which keeps existing project manifests valid. Base rejects
manifests with a schema version newer than the installed Base understands so
future team-facing manifest expansion can fail with a clear upgrade message
instead of ambiguous parser behavior.

`project.languages` is additive project taxonomy. It is an explicit,
allowlisted list that may describe a polyglot repository; it does not infer
toolchain ownership or make unsupported language setup automatic. The
`python.manager: uv` field remains the separate Python environment contract.

The Python layer interprets this declarative manifest and translates it into
orchestration actions. The design rule is delegation-first:

- Use Homebrew's own `Brewfile`/`brew bundle` flow for ordinary macOS packages.
- Use `mise` for tool versions, language runtimes, environment variables, and
  future tasks when a project opts into it. Base runs `mise install` during
  setup and does not reimplement mise's version management.
- For Go and Java projects, put runtime pins such as `go = "1.22"` and
  `java = "temurin-21"` in `.mise.toml`. Keep system tools in `Brewfile`, Go
  dependencies in `go.mod`/`go.sum`, and Java dependencies in Maven or Gradle
  project files. Base should orchestrate those contracts rather than add
  generic language package artifact types.
- Use a project-owned `test` contract for `basectl test <project>` delegation.
  Projects can declare either `test.command` for a shell command or `test.mise`
  for a `mise run <task>` delegation. Extra arguments after `basectl test
  <project> --` are passed through to the delegated command.
- Use a project-owned `commands` map for additional named commands that
  `basectl run <project> <command>` can execute from the project root. These
  commands use the same Base project environment and virtual environment
  contract as `basectl test`; the command name `test` is reserved for the
  top-level `test` contract.
- Use `health.required_env` for local environment contracts that `basectl check`
  and `basectl doctor` should validate without exposing secret values.
- Use `health.required_ports` for local TCP port contracts that should be
  explicitly `listening` or `free`. Base checks connection state only; it does
  not mutate local services, inspect process ownership, or replace future
  Docker Compose health checks.
- Use `activate.source` for explicit project activation scripts that need to
  affect the interactive runtime shell, such as local environment loading,
  aliases, or functions. Source paths must be relative to the project root and
  must resolve inside that root.
- Let Base own Base-aware package reconciliation and any project virtual
  environment explicitly requested by `python:` or `python-package` manifest
  contracts. Shell-only manifests use the Base runtime for control-plane work.
- Do not run arbitrary project setup hooks until Base has a clear safety
  contract for dry-run behavior, interactivity, setup diagnostics, and broader
  side effects. See [setup-hooks.md](setup-hooks.md) for the setup no-hooks
  decision and future reconsideration criteria.

Base owns the curated tool artifact registry only for things it must manage
directly. The current registry is `cli/python/base_setup/registry.py`.

The optional top-level `brewfile` field delegates ordinary Homebrew dependencies
to Homebrew's native `brew bundle` flow. The path is relative to the project root
and must stay inside the project. Base runs `brew bundle --file=<path>` during
setup before reconciling Base-managed artifacts.

`python-package` artifacts are pass-through PyPI package names and install into
the project virtual environment at `<project-root>/.venv` for non-Base projects
by default. Base's own project venv remains `~/.base.d/base/.venv`, and a
non-Base project can explicitly keep the historical external location with
`python.venv_location: external`. The wrapper `bin/base-wrapper` runs Python
packages through that project-scoped venv.

A structured `python:` manifest section owns Python project runtime policy.
`python.manager: uv` delegates environment setup to uv. `python.requires_python`
lets a project select a supported Python 3.10 through 3.13 minor for
Base-managed virtualenv creation, while check/doctor distinguish unsupported
requests from supported-but-unavailable interpreters. See
[python-manifest.md](python-manifest.md) for the current contract and migration
boundary.

A manifest requires project Python when it contains a top-level `python:`
mapping, including an explicit empty `python: {}`, or declares at least one
`python-package` artifact. `project.languages: [python]` remains taxonomy and
does not independently create an environment. When neither project-Python
contract is present, setup, check, and doctor run Base-owned parsing and
reconciliation from `~/.base.d/base/.venv`, skip Base's default project Python
bootstrap artifacts, and do not require `<project-root>/.venv`. Workspace
status reports that venv as `not_applicable` rather than missing.

This is the shell-only vertical slice of the broader runtime-boundary work in
[#1611](https://github.com/basefoundry/base/issues/1611). Activation and
project-owned run, test, build, and demo command environment semantics retain
their existing routing in this slice; the remaining migration should continue
to separate Base control-plane execution from project-owned runtime execution
without adding another special-purpose runtime.

Homebrew-managed `tool` artifacts currently support `version: latest`. If a
project requests a pinned Homebrew version, setup fails clearly instead of
silently installing a different version. For `version: latest`, check and doctor
report installed-but-outdated Homebrew packages, and setup upgrades them. New
ordinary Homebrew tools should prefer Brewfile delegation over registry growth.
Richer version conflict handling across projects is a later iteration, not part
of the initial build.

Default artifacts can be marked with `bootstrap: true` when they are required to
run Base's Python CLI layer inside a project virtual environment before the rest
of that project's artifacts are reconciled. In the current default manifest,
`click` and `PyYAML` carry this marker.

Artifact install commands keep stdout attached to the terminal so long-running
tools such as `brew` and `pip` remain live and readable while setup runs. Base's
persistent log records the command intent and captures stderr on failures. If
Base later needs full install transcripts, it should add tee-style streaming so
users still see progress while stdout is also preserved in the log.

---

## Project Model Scope

Base's project model is deliberately flat and simple: **one repository equals one
project, and all projects are peer siblings under a shared parent directory.**

This constraint is a feature, not a limitation. It keeps the manifest readable,
the discovery logic fast, and the activation model unambiguous. The four most
common requests to extend this model — and why each is out of scope:

### Parent-child manifest inheritance

A child project that inherits its parent's manifest looks attractive for sharing
common artifacts across related projects. Base already has two manifest layers
that address this need: `lib/base/default_manifest.yaml` for shared bootstrap
defaults and each project's own `base_manifest.yaml`. A third layer creates an
inheritance chain where diagnosing "why is this artifact installed?" requires
tracing provenance across files rather than reading one manifest. It also
introduces discovery-order coupling — a child is broken in a non-obvious way
when its parent is not checked out.

The right escalation path: if the need is for shared Homebrew tools, use
Brewfile delegation. If the need is for shared Python packages, declare them in
each project's manifest. If Base ever needs an org-level layer, introduce a
workspace-level manifest at the parent directory rather than reaching for
inheritance.

### Project groups sharing a manifest

If two projects share a manifest they are probably not two separate projects —
they are one project with two source trees. A group concept introduces a new
entity (group vs. project vs. member) with no clear semantics for which project
gets activated when the user runs `basectl activate`. Closely coupled components
should either be treated as one project or kept as independent projects that
happen to declare the same artifacts.

### Multiple projects within a single repository

Scanning a repository tree for nested `base_manifest.yaml` files makes
`basectl projects list` traverse potentially thousands of directories. It also
conflicts with the activation model — `basectl activate <project>` assumes a
project root is a repository root, so one active context maps cleanly to one
directory. Sub-repo manifests blur that mapping in ways that affect the prompt,
PATH manipulation, and virtual environment selection.

What already works: `discover_manifest` in the standalone
[`base-cli` package](https://github.com/basefoundry/base-cli/blob/main/lib/python/base_cli/paths.py)
walks upward from the current directory, so a manifest anywhere in a repository subtree
is found when `basectl` is invoked from that directory. The gap is only in
`basectl projects list`, which enumerates workspace siblings rather than trees.
If a specific monorepo layout genuinely needs enumeration, the least-invasive
path is to scan exactly one additional level and require explicit opt-in from a
parent manifest rather than auto-discovering everything.

### Workspace manifest

A workspace manifest is a team-shared repository set contract. It is distinct from
each project's `base_manifest.yaml`: the workspace manifest says which
repositories should belong together, while project manifests say how each
repository participates in Base.

Workspace commands operate on discovered local projects by default. Configuring
`workspace.manifest` or supplying `--manifest <path>` adds expected-repository
awareness without changing the default discovered-project behavior. The
command-line manifest takes precedence over user config. See
[Workspace Manifest](workspace-manifest.md).

### Caching project definitions

Base keeps project discovery flat: it scans direct children of the workspace
root for `base_manifest.yaml` files instead of traversing repository trees. That
keeps discovery predictable, but repeated YAML parsing still shows up in
project-aware commands and shell completion.

The implemented cache is intentionally narrow. Base stores discovered project
metadata under `base/cache/discovery/`, keyed by the resolved workspace path.
On each discovery run it still checks the immediate workspace
children, but it reuses cached project names and paths when the manifest path,
mtime, and size set is unchanged. A new checkout, manifest edit, or manifest
removal changes that key data and forces a fresh parse.

This cache is an optimization, not an authority. The manifest files remain the
source of truth, and corrupt or unwritable cache files are ignored.

---

## Workspace Operations

Workspace operations supply the inventory and onboarding evidence for the core
outcome. The command surface should make local state visible before it mutates
many projects.

Current workspace-oriented commands include:

```bash
basectl projects list
basectl workspace status
basectl workspace check
basectl workspace doctor
basectl workspace onboarding
basectl workspace agent-brief
basectl workspace clone
basectl workspace pull
basectl workspace update
basectl workspace init
basectl workspace configure
basectl workspace setup
```

Workspace commands are read-first and mutate only through explicit init, clone,
pull, update, configure, or setup commands. `workspace configure` additionally
requires `--apply`; `--yes` only supplies confirmation after apply is authorized.
`basectl workspace status` reports project manifest
state, virtual environment state, and Git state across discovered projects,
including invalid manifests without stopping the whole scan. With
`workspace.manifest` or `--manifest <path>`, workspace commands also report
missing required repositories, missing optional repositories, and discovered
Base-managed projects outside the expected repository set. `basectl workspace check`
and `basectl workspace doctor` run project checks and diagnostics across
discovered projects. `basectl workspace onboarding` is a shipped read-only text
or JSON summary of ready, needs-setup, invalid-manifest, missing-required, and
missing-optional first-day repository state; it does not clone repositories or
run setup. `basectl workspace agent-brief` is a separate read-only text or JSON
projection over manifest and local filesystem state. It includes expected and
extra Base-managed repositories, reports baseline, agent-guidance, AI-context,
environment, and validation signals, and recommends explicit next commands
without executing them or making network calls. Environment evidence only
checks for the expected executable interpreter file and reports it as
unverified; the brief does not run repository-local code. `basectl workspace clone`
materializes missing expected repositories only when invoked
directly. `basectl workspace pull` updates only the local workspace manifest
after validating an explicit or configured source. `basectl workspace init`
bootstraps a workspace from a workspace configuration repository and can
materialize member repositories. `basectl workspace configure` previews the
existing `repo configure` repair path by default and applies it only with
`--apply` across discovered Base-managed workspace repositories.
`basectl workspace update` walks the manifest in order and runs
`git pull --ff-only` for present repositories, continuing after individual
failures. It skips the active `BASE_HOME` control plane when that checkout is
the manifest's `base` target; a separate workspace checkout is eligible for
update. `basectl workspace setup` walks the manifest in order and
delegates eligible local repositories to `basectl setup`, forwarding `--yes`
when requested. It continues after individual failures and returns a failure
when any setup target fails; dry-run reports required missing or invalid targets
as failures without modifying repositories. JSON output is part of the
status/check/doctor/onboarding/agent-brief contract so automation and future CI
smoke checks can use the same data.

Future workspace commands should follow the same principles:

- start with read-only status, check, doctor, onboarding, and handoff behavior
- require explicit commands and dry-run paths before mutating many repositories
  or local workspace metadata
- treat partial failure as normal in multi-repo workspaces
- keep sibling repositories under a shared workspace root as the default
  discovery model
- report machine-readable summaries early

---

## Doctor And Observability

`basectl doctor` is a core trust-building feature. It should explain what is
wrong, why it matters, whether Base can fix it, and the safest next command.
Doctor output must stay non-mutating unless a future explicit fix command is
designed with dry-run behavior.

Doctor findings use stable identifiers documented in
[Doctor Finding IDs](doctor-findings.md). Automation and runbooks should match
on those IDs instead of human-readable messages.

Base should also remain locally observable. `basectl logs` exposes recent Base
CLI runtime logs from the Base cache root, `basectl history` lists the
structured local command-history index, and `basectl history --report`
summarizes recent local activity without sending telemetry anywhere.
Useful command metadata includes the command, target project or workspace,
start and end time, exit code, manifest version where relevant, external tools
invoked, and log file paths.

The goal is explainability, not surveillance. Base should help users understand
what happened on their own machine.

These surfaces also provide today's handoff evidence: onboarding reports explain
initial repo state, `workspace agent-brief` summarizes repository handoff
signals and ordered next actions, check/doctor provide current readiness,
history reports show recent local command outcomes, and `.ai-context` exports
carry canonical orientation. The issue-oriented handoff bundle planned in
[#1562](https://github.com/basefoundry/base/issues/1562) remains separate; it
may compose issue, branch, history, diagnostics, and context evidence, but is
not a shipped command or stable schema.

## Mac Bootstrap Sequence

On a fresh Mac, installation and first-run setup use this sequence:

1. Check for Homebrew — install if missing
2. Check for Xcode CLI tools — install if missing
3. Install Python (target version) via Homebrew
4. Create Base's own virtual environment at `~/.base.d/base/.venv`
5. Install Base's Python bootstrap dependencies into `~/.base.d/base/.venv`
6. After `basectl setup` finishes, explicitly run `basectl update-profile` as a
   separate one-time shell-profile step; run it again only when updating
   Base-managed shell dotfiles
7. Scan the parent directory for peer repos with base manifests
8. For a shell-only setup target, run manifest reconciliation from Base's own
   venv without creating a project venv. For a target that explicitly declares
   project Python, seed its project venv with `bootstrap: true` default
   artifacts, then run reconciliation through `base-wrapper --project
   <project>`.

Homebrew installation follows Homebrew's official `install/HEAD/install.sh`
bootstrap command. That means Base intentionally trusts Homebrew's mutable
installer entry point instead of pinning a commit SHA. Pinning would reduce
installer mutability, but would also make Base responsible for tracking
Homebrew installer updates and could diverge from Homebrew's documented support
path. Environments with stricter supply-chain policy should preinstall Homebrew
through managed workstation provisioning before invoking `basectl setup`.

## GitHub and Repository Conventions

These conventions are a supporting workflow pack for the operating contract;
they are not the core readiness category.

- Base uses a public GitHub repository at `basefoundry/base`.
- GitHub Issues are the official product backlog for bugs, feature requests,
  release work, maintenance, and documentation follow-up.
- `basectl release` manages annotated tags and GitHub Releases for Base using
  the manifest-owned release metadata in `base_manifest.yaml`.
- The Homebrew tap at `basefoundry/homebrew-base` owns the formula that installs
  published Base releases.
- Homebrew tap updates happen after each GitHub Release and remain a manual
  handoff. `basectl release` prints the required tap follow-up when the project
  manifest declares Homebrew metadata.

## Adoption Signals

Base should measure product readiness through concrete local workflows:

- one-command install works on a clean supported macOS machine
- a public demo project can be cloned, set up, checked, tested, diagnosed, and
  demonstrated by Base
- a technically adjacent user can complete guided onboarding without reading
  private internal notes
- a second human or coding agent can reconstruct readiness and recent local
  evidence without an undocumented maintainer briefing
- multiple project types are supported through adapters instead of
  special-case code
- `doctor` identifies and explains the most common local failure modes
- JSON output is stable enough for automation and CI smoke checks

These are not analytics goals. They are acceptance signals for whether Base is
becoming useful beyond one personal machine.

## Utility Scripts and Extras

Base ships with a small collection of utility scripts useful for day-to-day Mac
development:

- Shell helper functions for common operations
- Python library utilities for unified CLI development (shared across Base-managed
  projects)
- Git convenience helpers (branch management, PR workflows)
- Potentially: a base-provided Python CLI framework so that projects built within the
  Base ecosystem share a consistent CLI style

These extras emerge organically from real needs — they are not designed upfront.

## What Base Is Not

For the canonical non-goals and ecosystem boundary, see
[Tool Boundaries](tool-boundaries.md#what-base-is-not).

## Settled Design References

Several questions from the early architecture pass now have dedicated reference
documents:

- Workspace manifest location, trust, clone, pull, and team-onboarding policy
  are covered by [Workspace Manifest](workspace-manifest.md).
- Non-Python projects stay inside the Base manifest command contract and use
  project-owned tools through `basectl run`, `basectl test`, `mise`, or direct
  shell commands. See [Tool Boundaries](tool-boundaries.md) and
  [Python Manifest Section](python-manifest.md).
- Docker and dev container integration remain coexistence and orchestration
  topics rather than Base-owned container management. See
  [Tool Boundaries](tool-boundaries.md).

Remaining questions should be tracked as GitHub Issues when they become concrete
enough to affect a project or release.

## Relationship to Banyanlabs

Base is the prerequisite for banyanlabs. Banyanlabs (a multi-cloud, polyglot DevOps
learning environment) will be a Base-managed project — it will have a base manifest
declaring all its infrastructure tool dependencies. Base handles the bootstrapping.
Banyanlabs handles the learning environment. A Banyanlabs-specific installer can
bootstrap or locate Base, clone the project, and call `basectl setup` with
friendlier product-specific messaging. See [Project Installers](project-installers.md)
for that boundary. Base must ship first.
