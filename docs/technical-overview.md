# Base — Technical and Product Overview

Status: maintained product and technical reference
Last reviewed: 2026-08-15

## What It Is

**Base** is a macOS-first local operating contract for developers who work across
multiple independent Git repositories checked out side by side under a shared
directory (typically `~/work/`). Rather than forcing unrelated codebases into a
monorepo, Base makes the repo set understandable, locally ready, explicitly
trusted, onboardable, and transferable through one inspectable CLI contract.

Its durable product loop is:

```text
inventory -> prepare -> verify -> trust -> onboard -> hand off
```

The `basectl` CLI provides the execution surface for that loop, including setup,
diagnostics, project discovery, shell activation, test execution, and releases.

> The repo you check out once per workspace so all other repos become easier to
> set up, test, and run.

## Why It Exists

Multi-repo development has a recurring problem: every project has a different
bootstrap story, and the glue between projects — shared env vars, shared tools,
consistent shell environments — lives in fragile ad-hoc dotfiles or one-off
scripts. Base formalizes that glue without absorbing project-specific logic.

It gives the repo set a common, inspectable operating contract:

1. **Inventory** — identify participating repositories and their declarations.
2. **Prepare** — reconcile the tools and environments those declarations need.
3. **Verify and trust** — report readiness and require explicit consent before
   running project-owned commands.
4. **Onboard and hand off** — guide first use and preserve local evidence for the
   next implementer without taking project behavior away from its owner.

## Target Workspace Shape

```
~/work/
  base/           ← Base itself (source checkout or Homebrew install)
  project-a/      ← has base_manifest.yaml
  project-b/      ← has base_manifest.yaml
  infra/          ← another peer repo opted into Base
```

Projects opt in by placing a `base_manifest.yaml` at their root. Base discovers
them by scanning the workspace root.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Orchestration | Bash 4.2+ |
| Data / artifacts | Python 3.10+ |
| CLI framework | Click (wrapped by `base_cli`) |
| Manifest format | YAML (`base_manifest.yaml`) |
| Package management | Homebrew (tools), pip/venv (Python) |
| Runtime versioning | `mise` (optional, per-project) |
| Testing | BATS (Bash), pytest (Python) |
| Static analysis | ShellCheck, Pylint, Bandit, pip-audit |
| CI | GitHub Actions (tests, lint, skills) |

## Architecture: Three Layers

**Layer 1 — Dotfile integration** (`basectl update-profile`)

Manages small marked sections in `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zprofile`,
and `~/.zshrc`. Adds `$BASE_HOME/bin` to `PATH`. Never takes over whole dotfiles.
Markers look like:

```bash
# >>> base: bashrc managed >>>
# ... Base-managed content ...
# <<< base: bashrc managed <<<
```

**Layer 2 — Base runtime** (`base_init.sh`, sourced on every `basectl` invocation)

Exports `BASE_HOME`, `BASE_BIN_DIR`, `BASE_BASH_LIB_DIR`,
`BASE_BASH_LIBS_DIR`, `BASE_BASH_LIBS_SOURCE`, `BASE_OS`, `BASE_PLATFORM`,
`BASE_HOST_ENV`, `BASE_HOST`, and
`BASE_SHELL`. Loads the Bash standard library from the resolved reusable
library root. Sets up
`import_base_lib` for convention-based library imports from that reusable root.
The standalone install path and post-migration contract for those reusable
libraries are documented in [Base Bash Libraries](base-bash-libs.md).

**Layer 3 — Project environment** (`basectl activate <project>`)

Spawns a Bash runtime shell, sets `BASE_PROJECT`, applies the project runtime
route, runs `activate.source` scripts declared in the manifest, and updates the
prompt to `[project: branch] ~/path $`. Python projects activate their selected
project venv. Shell-only setup/check/doctor work does not create one solely for
Base's runtime. Exit that shell to return to the original environment -
no deactivation logic needed.

**Design choice — no `cd`-triggered activation:** switching directories does not
change environment. Users explicitly activate projects with `basectl activate`.
This is deliberate; auto-activation on `cd` is ambiguous and error-prone.

## Project Manifest Contract

Each project opts into Base with a small declarative YAML file at its root. All
fields are optional:

```yaml
schema_version: 1

project:
  name: example

brewfile: Brewfile          # delegates to brew bundle
mise: .mise.toml            # delegates to mise install

artifacts:                  # Python packages → project venv
  - type: python-package
    name: requests
    version: latest

health:
  required_env: [DATABASE_URL]
  required_ports:
    - { name: postgres, port: 5432, state: listening }

activate:
  source: [.base/activate.sh]

test:
  command: pytest tests/    # or: mise: test

commands:
  dev: uvicorn app:app --reload
  lint: ruff check .

build:
  default: [api]
  targets:
    api:
      command: go build ./cmd/api
      working_dir: services/api

ide:
  vs-code:
    extensions: [ms-python.python]

release:
  version_file: VERSION
  changelog: CHANGELOG.md
```

**Design principle:** manifests describe *what* the project needs, not *how* to do
arbitrary setup. There are no setup hooks. Projects delegate to Homebrew, `mise`,
and their own build systems. See [Setup Hooks Boundary](setup-hooks.md).

| `ai` | Codex CLI, Claude Code |
| `linux-lab` | Multipass for local Ubuntu lab VMs on macOS hosts |

## Installation Paths

| Method | Best for |
|---|---|
| `curl … bootstrap.sh \| bash` | Blank macOS machine; installs Homebrew, Git, Bash, then Base |
| `brew trust basefoundry/base` + `brew install basefoundry/base/base` | Users wanting Base installed as a managed tool |
| `git clone` + `basectl setup` | Contributors / Base developers |
| `curl … install.sh \| bash` | Source-install shortcut |

Homebrew installs should trust the `basefoundry/base` tap before installing
Base. The tap owns both `base` and the `base-bash-libs` dependency, and the
trust command is safe to rerun on machines that already trust the tap.

All paths converge on the same daily command surface. After any install, finish
with:

```bash
basectl setup
basectl update-profile
exec "$SHELL" -l
```

## Key File Locations

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.base.d/config.yaml` | Machine-local config (workspace root, workspace manifest, canonical manifest source, log level) |
| `<project-root>/.venv` | Default non-Base project Python virtual environment when the manifest declares `python:` or `python-package` artifacts; not created for shell-only control-plane work |
| `~/.base.d/<project>/.venv` | Historical external project Python virtual environment when `python.venv_location: external` is set |
| `~/.base.d/<project>/checks/last.json` | Latest recorded `basectl check <project>` result used by workspace status |
| `~/Library/Caches/base/` | Runtime logs, temp files, project discovery cache |
| `~/.baserc` | User preferences (e.g., `BASE_DEBUG=1`) |
| `~/.base.d/profile.conf` | Shell defaults opt-in state |

## Testing

| Layer | Tool | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Bash unit tests | BATS | `cli/bash/commands/basectl/tests/`, `lib/bash/*/tests/` |
| Python unit tests | pytest | `cli/python/*/tests/`, `lib/python/*/tests/` |
| Integration tests | BATS | `tests/integration/base_workflows.bats` |
| Shell static analysis | ShellCheck | All `*.sh` files |
| Python lint | Pylint | `cli/python/`, `lib/python/` (3.10–3.13 matrix) |
| Python security scan | Bandit | `cli/python/`, `lib/python/` |
| Python dependency audit | pip-audit | `requirements-dev.txt` |

Run everything locally with `basectl test base` or `bin/base-test`.

## Current Status

Base **1.8.0** (August 2026) covers: first-mile `bootstrap.sh`
installation, setup, check, doctor, project discovery, workspace
status/check/doctor/clone/pull/init/configure, `basectl onboard`, project activation
(subshell), test execution, build targets, named commands, demo scripts,
explicit `python.manager: uv` project support, standalone and source-checkout
`base-bash-libs` consumption, repository baseline creation, guarded GitHub
release publishing, AI context export, repo-owned prompt rendering, local
command history, manifest-declared PR policy, Base-managed artifact
declarations, `--ci` mode for non-interactive CI, IDE bootstrapping (VS
Code/Cursor), release readiness inspection, the `basectl docs` documentation
shortcut, CI setup JSON output improvements, CI supply-chain policy enforcement,
pinned Homebrew installer variables for verified first-mile bootstrap, and
apt-backed Ubuntu/Debian setup support.

The setup/check/doctor platform contract is implemented for macOS and
Ubuntu/Debian Linux. Broader Linux families, WSL, and native Windows remain
outside the supported contract unless a later platform policy explicitly adds
them.
