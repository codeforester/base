# Base Execution Model

Status: maintained runtime reference
Last reviewed: 2026-07-25

This document describes the current `basectl` execution contract. It is about
what happens after a user invokes Base, not the future project-discovery or
Python orchestration layers.

## Public Entrypoint

`bin/basectl` is the public control-plane command for Base. Base exposes one
public executable directory: `$BASE_HOME/bin`.

`basectl` is responsible for deciding what kind of invocation the user asked
for. It then delegates runtime setup to `base_init.sh`.

Wrapper diagnostics are consumed before command dispatch. Use `-v` for
command-level DEBUG logging, `-x` for Bash xtrace, `--debug-wrapper` for early
wrapper DEBUG logging, `--utc-wrapper` for wrapper/runtime timestamps in UTC,
and `--keep-temp` to preserve temporary run files.

At a high level, `basectl` can:

- start a Base-enabled interactive Bash shell
- run the umbrella Base command dispatcher
- run a Base command implementation by convention
- run an explicit Bash script path inside the Base runtime

## Base Home Discovery

`basectl` derives `BASE_HOME` from its own location. In the normal layout,
`bin/basectl` lives directly under `$BASE_HOME/bin`, so the parent of `bin/` is
Base home.

This is intentionally a filesystem-layout contract, not a Git contract. Base
does not require `$BASE_HOME` to be the root of a Git repository. That keeps the
same runtime model usable when Base is checked out as its own repo or embedded
inside a larger repository.

`BASE_HOME` is the selected Base installation root. For Homebrew installs this
should remain on Homebrew's stable `opt` path, such as
`/usr/local/opt/base/libexec` or `/opt/homebrew/opt/base/libexec`, rather than a
versioned Cellar path. It is not the developer workspace root, and it is not
changed by `~/.base.d/config.yaml`. Project-discovery commands use the
configured `workspace.root` from `~/.base.d/config.yaml` when present, then fall
back to `BASE_HOME`'s parent for source-checkout layouts.

The Base home check validates the expected Base files instead of checking for a
`.git` directory.

## Dispatch Order

When `basectl` starts, it uses this dispatch order:

1. If no arguments are provided and stdin/stdout are attached to a terminal,
   start a Base-enabled interactive Bash shell with Base's project virtual
   environment activated, while preserving the caller's current directory.
2. If the first argument is an explicit path containing `/`, treat it as a Bash
   script path and run that script inside the Base runtime.
3. If the first argument matches a Base command implementation by convention,
   run that command implementation.
4. Otherwise, run the umbrella Base command dispatcher.

This ordering lets explicit script paths win while ensuring a local file cannot
shadow a Base control command with the same name. The umbrella dispatcher checks
its named commands before reporting an unknown bare file; if that file exists,
the error includes a hint to use an explicit path such as `./script.sh`.

## Script Arguments

A first argument is treated as a script only when it contains `/`, such as
`./script.sh`, `scripts/deploy`, or `/tmp/base-task.sh`. A bare file name is not
executed implicitly; use an explicit relative or absolute path instead.

Script files do not need a `.sh` extension. The script is sourced as Bash and
must define a `main` function. After sourcing the script, `basectl` calls
`main "$@"` with the remaining arguments.

For command naming, a trailing `.sh` is stripped from
`BASE_BASH_COMMAND_NAME`. Other extensions are left intact.

Examples:

```bash
basectl ./scripts/deploy.sh prod
basectl scripts/deploy prod
basectl ./deploy.sh prod
```

A script can also opt into Base with a shebang:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env basectl

main() {
    local project="${1:-}"

    if [[ -z "$project" ]]; then
        print_error "Project name is required."
        return 2
    fi

    log_info "Checking project '$project'."
    run git status --short
}
```

In shebang mode, the script defines `main` but does not call `main "$@"`
itself. The operating system runs `basectl` with the script path as an
argument. `basectl` then:

1. resolves `BASE_HOME`
2. treats the script path as an explicit Bash script
3. exports runtime metadata such as `BASE_BASH_COMMAND_NAME`,
   `BASE_BASH_COMMAND_DIR`, and `BASE_BASH_COMMAND_SCRIPT`
4. sources `base_init.sh`, which loads Base runtime variables and the Bash
   standard library
5. sources the script
6. calls `main` with the remaining user arguments

This makes Base stdlib helpers such as `base_std_log_info`, `base_std_print_error`,
`base_std_fatal_error`, `base_std_run`, `base_std_assert_command_exists`, and
`import_base_lib` available
without the script sourcing `lib_std.sh` directly.

Standalone Bash scripts that are not intended to run through Base should use the
standalone `base-bash-libs` package:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
base_bash_libs_prefix="$(brew --prefix basefoundry/base/base-bash-libs)"
source "$base_bash_libs_prefix/libexec/lib/bash/std/lib_std.sh"

main() {
    run echo "hello"
}

main "$@"
```

## Command Implementations

Base command implementations are found by convention:

```text
$BASE_HOME/cli/bash/commands/<command>/<command>.sh
```

For example:

```bash
basectl example
```

loads:

```text
$BASE_HOME/cli/bash/commands/example/example.sh
```

A command implementation is sourced as Bash and must define `main`.

## Umbrella Base Command

The umbrella command implementation lives at:

```text
$BASE_HOME/cli/bash/commands/basectl/basectl.sh
```

It owns the current Base subcommands. The canonical, always-current command
list is `basectl --help`; this list summarizes the shipped public surface:

- `setup`
- `check`
- `clean`
- `doctor`
- `activate`
- `test`
- `build`
- `base_std_run`
- `demo`
- `repo`
- `release`
- `logs`
- `history`
- `docs`
- `export-context`
- `prompt`
- `workspace`
- `onboard`
- `gh`
- `config`
- `update`
- `projects list`
- `update-profile`
- `version`
- `help`

Subcommand modules for the umbrella command live under:

```text
$BASE_HOME/cli/bash/commands/basectl/subcommands/
```

## Public Command Launchers

Base-owned convenience commands in `$BASE_HOME/bin` should be tiny real launcher
files, not symlinks. They delegate to `basectl` and keep the public command
surface in one place.

Example for a hypothetical Base-owned Bash command:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec "$(dirname "$0")/basectl" example "$@"
```

The implementation still lives under `cli/bash/commands/<command>/` with its
local README and tests.

Optional utility CLIs such as `caff` and `sort-in-place` live in
[`basefoundry/base-platform-tools`](https://github.com/basefoundry/base-platform-tools)
instead of Base core.

When `base-platform-tools` is checked out next to Base and contains both
`base_manifest.yaml` and `bin/`, Base's shell startup snippets add its `bin/`
directory to `PATH` after `$BASE_HOME/bin`. Runtime project shells keep project
`bin/` entries behind both Base and Base Platform Tools.

## Runtime Bootstrap

`base_init.sh` is the runtime bootstrap layer. It is sourced after `basectl`
has decided what should run.

`base_init.sh` establishes the Base runtime contract, including:

- exported Base environment variables such as `BASE_HOME`, `BASE_BIN_DIR`,
  `BASE_BASH_COMMANDS_DIR`, `BASE_BASH_LIB_DIR`, `BASE_BASH_LIBS_DIR`, and
  `BASE_BASH_LIBS_SOURCE`
- OS and host metadata such as `BASE_OS`, `BASE_PLATFORM`, `BASE_HOST_ENV`, and `BASE_HOST`
- the reusable Bash standard library, resolved from `base-bash-libs`
- `import_base_lib`, the convention-based helper for sourcing Base Bash
  libraries from the resolved reusable root
- PATH additions needed by Base runtime execution

The full variable list, ownership rules, readonly policy, and `~/.baserc`
behavior are documented in [Runtime Environment](runtime-environment.md).

Downstream Bash scripts should import Base Bash libraries with:

```bash
import_base_lib file/lib_file.sh
import_base_lib str/lib_str.sh
```

`import_base_lib` checks the resolved reusable library root. It fails through
Base standard error handling when the requested library cannot be found, so
callers do not need to duplicate that check.

The standalone install path, Base resolution order, and post-migration boundary
are documented in [Base Bash Libraries](base-bash-libs.md).

## Python-To-Bash Command Metadata

Base's Python project commands keep their default `text` output for people and
existing direct callers. Bash orchestration does not parse that display format.
It explicitly requests the internal `--format command-protocol` transport when
it needs project, route, command, build, demo, activation, or project-list
metadata.

The transport starts with `BASE_COMMAND_PROTOCOL_V1`, declares one record type
and record count, and carries records with explicit field names and wire types.
UTF-8 strings use lowercase hexadecimal framing, booleans use `true` or
`false`, and nullable strings distinguish `null` from an empty string. Decoders
validate the exact schema, framing, types, UTF-8, and canonical decimal record
count before a caller uses any value. Version 1 caps the count at 1,000,000.
NUL is rejected because Bash variables cannot represent it.

This is an internal Base boundary, not a public automation format. Production
Bash callers must not fall back to tab-position parsing, and the decoder does
not require `jq` or another Python process. The standalone Bash and Zsh
completion scripts use narrow readers for the same versioned
`project-list-entry`, `named-command`, and `build-target` records because
completion can load before the full Base runtime; the Bash reader remains
compatible with macOS system Bash 3. Completion requests these records through
read-only dry-run paths and never executes or trusts manifest commands. Normal
Base command paths use `lib/bash/runtime/command_protocol.sh`.

## Runtime Shell

Running `basectl activate <project>` starts an interactive Bash shell with the
Base runtime loaded and the project virtual environment activated. Running
`basectl` with no arguments in a terminal starts the Base project runtime while
preserving the caller's current directory.

That shell uses Base's runtime rcfile:

```text
$BASE_HOME/lib/bash/runtime/bashrc
```

The runtime rcfile sources `base_init.sh`, sources the user's `~/.bashrc` once
with guardrails, activates the project virtual environment, sources any
manifest-declared `activate.source` scripts, and then sets the Base runtime
prompt. This gives the user their normal interactive Bash behavior while also
making Base stdlib functions such as `import_base_lib` available during user
Bash startup. Base still owns the final runtime prompt.

Bash startup paths share `lib/shell/baserc_guard.sh` for safe `~/.baserc`
loading and Base-owned variable protection. See
[Runtime Environment](runtime-environment.md) for the exact variables users may
set there.

## Dotfile Boundary

The normal shell-startup snippets under `lib/shell/` do not source
`base_init.sh`. They only manage Bash/Zsh startup concerns, including:

- deriving `BASE_HOME` for the managed snippet
- adding `$BASE_HOME/bin` to `PATH`
- adding an optional sibling `base-platform-tools/bin` to `PATH`
- loading simple user preferences from `~/.baserc`
- enabling optional shell defaults when requested

The full Base runtime is loaded only through the `basectl` command path.

## Current Non-Goals

The current execution model intentionally does not define:

- Windows support.
- Fish, tcsh, ksh, or other non-Bash/non-Zsh interactive shell support.
- Automatic directory-triggered activation when a user runs `cd`.
- Arbitrary project-provided setup hooks outside the manifest contract.
- Full Linux bootstrap or installer support beyond the current runtime-oriented
  CI path.

Future work in those areas should build on this execution contract rather than
bypass it.
