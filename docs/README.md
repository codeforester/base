# Base Documentation

This directory holds design, architecture, and operational documentation for
Base. The top-level [README](../README.md) is the product front door, and
[FAQ.md](../FAQ.md) answers common first-run and product questions. This page is
the documentation map.

For contribution workflow, branch naming, tests, and PR expectations, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

For GitHub labels, milestones, Projects, issue assignment, branch names, and
worktree-based PR trains, see [GitHub Workflow](github-workflow.md).

For release preparation, tagging, GitHub Releases, and the Homebrew tap update,
see [Release Process](release-process.md).

For self-guided or live walkthrough material, see
[Presentations](presentations/README.md).

Base's product outcome is a local operating contract for deterministic readiness
and handoff across independent Git repositories. The durable loop is
inventory -> prepare -> verify -> trust -> onboard -> hand off. See [Why Base](why-base.md)
for the concise product framing; the map below links to the deeper references.

## Internal Planning Artifacts

The `docs/superpowers/` directory contains agent-written planning artifacts
such as implementation plans and feature specs. These files are useful for
understanding how a change was shaped, but they are not the canonical product
contract. Treat the mapped documents below, the top-level README, FAQ, and
CHANGELOG as the normative documentation for shipped Base behavior.

## Naming Convention

Use stable topic names for documentation files:

- `architecture.md` for the broad product and system architecture.
- `<feature>.md` for focused feature designs such as `ide-bootstrapping.md`.
- `<domain>-<topic>.md` when a shorter topic name would be ambiguous.
- Avoid generic names such as `design.md` once the subject is known.

Document titles can still say whether a page is a design, model, boundary, or
reference. The filename should answer "what is this about?"

  local command history index, `basectl history --report`, and future diagnostic
  report work beyond raw runtime logs.
