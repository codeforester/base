# `basectl repo` Ownership Map

Status: maintained implementation boundary map
Last reviewed: 2026-08-25

`basectl repo` has grown from local baseline generation into a mixed local and
GitHub workflow surface. This page maps the current responsibilities so future
refactors can reduce `repo.sh` safely without changing public command behavior.

## Current Responsibility Map

| Responsibility | Current public commands | Current owner | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Command dispatch and usage routing | `basectl repo ...` | Bash | Keep in Bash as the thin public front-end. |
| `repo init` option parsing and orchestration | `repo init` | `repo_init.sh` | Keep the coordinator command-owned; reuse shared path, Git, dry-run, baseline-writer, and PR primitives from `repo.sh`. |
| Local path, config, and dry-run plumbing | all repo commands | Bash | Keep small shared Bash helpers until a broader repo command parser exists. |
| Local baseline file generation | `repo init`, `repo check` | Bash | Keep file writes in Bash for now; extract stable writer groups only when the file set is already well-covered by BATS. |
| Agent guidance generation | `repo agent-guidance` | Bash helper | Extracted to `repo_agent_guidance.sh`; it still uses shared repo path, write, and PR helpers from `repo.sh`. |
| Installer template generation | `repo installer-template` | Bash helper | Extracted to `repo_installer_template.sh`; it still uses shared repo path, write, and PR helpers from `repo.sh`. |
| GitHub repository settings and labels | `repo init`, `repo configure` | Bash helper | Extracted to `repo_github_settings.sh`; keep `gh` orchestration in Bash short-term and move structured payload construction behind Python only when behavior needs richer validation or reusable JSON construction. |
| Default branch protection | `repo configure` | Bash helper calling `gh api` | Extracted to `repo_github_settings.sh`; still a Python candidate if ruleset payloads grow or need deeper schema tests. |
| GitHub Project metadata | `repo init`, `repo configure` | Bash helper delegating to Python Project engine | `repo_github_settings.sh` owns wrapper handoff and messaging. Continue moving Project semantics into `base_github_projects`; Bash should only collect flags, locate repo config, and report wrapper output. |
| PR branch and generated PR creation | `repo init --pr`, `repo agent-guidance --pr`, `repo installer-template --pr` | Bash | Keep shared PR worktree and branch mechanics in Bash while Git remains the underlying tool. Extract generated PR body helpers by command as each command moves out. |
| Clone planning and `gh repo clone` handoff | `repo clone` | Bash | Keep in Bash unless clone config parsing moves into a general repo config parser. |

## Extraction Rules

- Preserve the existing `basectl repo` command surface and exit statuses.
- Prefer one command-specific extraction at a time.
- Leave shared path, Git, dry-run, logging, and PR worktree primitives in
  `repo.sh` until multiple extracted commands need a smaller common helper.
- Move structured GitHub Project behavior to Python, not to another Bash file.
- Add or keep focused BATS coverage for each extracted command before moving
  code.

## Completed Extractions

The first split moves `repo installer-template` implementation into
`cli/bash/commands/basectl/subcommands/repo_installer_template.sh`.

This is intentionally a Bash helper, not a Python rewrite. The command mostly
copies a maintained shell template, parses repo-specific flags, and optionally
uses the existing generated-PR helper path. Keeping it in Bash avoids changing
runtime behavior while proving that `repo.sh` can source command-owned helpers.

The second split moves `repo agent-guidance` generation into
`cli/bash/commands/basectl/subcommands/repo_agent_guidance.sh`. The helper owns
the generated guidance file content, command parsing, generated PR body, and
agent-guidance PR finish path while still reusing shared repo path, Git,
dry-run, logging, and PR worktree primitives from `repo.sh`.

The third split moves GitHub repository settings, labels, Base-managed default
branch protection ruleset handling, repository creation, and Project metadata
delegation into `cli/bash/commands/basectl/subcommands/repo_github_settings.sh`.
The helper still reuses shared repo formatting, `gh` readiness, path, and
project-support file helpers from `repo.sh`; this keeps `repo init` and
`repo configure` behavior unchanged while separating GitHub-side configuration
from local baseline generation.

The fourth split moves `repo init` option parsing and orchestration into
`cli/bash/commands/basectl/subcommands/repo_init.sh`. The helper keeps the
existing public `base_repo_init()` function and lazy-loads only for the `init`
command. Its coordinator now separates argument parsing, validation, PR
planning, baseline writing, PR finishing, and GitHub configuration. Local
baseline writers, GitHub settings, shared path handling, and PR worktree
primitives remain in their existing owners.

Follow-up candidates:

- Continue reducing Project-specific logic in Bash by delegating schema and
  field behavior to the Python Project engine.
