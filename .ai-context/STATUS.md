# Base Status Context

## Current Release

Base `1.8.0` is the current release. The repo-root `VERSION` file is updated
only during release-prep PRs, not on every ordinary PR. `DEVELOPMENT_VERSION`
records the numeric next development line; an untagged source checkout reports
that line with a Git revision and `.dirty` when applicable, while tagged and
packaged installs report the clean published version.

## Current Implemented Areas

The current command surface covers:

- setup and first-mile bootstrap
- targeted first-mile Bash 4.2+ repair through `bootstrap.sh --ensure-bash`
  without cloning Base or running full setup
- checks and doctor diagnostics
- project discovery
- project activation
- declared project test, build, run, and demo commands, including explicit
  `runner: uv` delegation
- advisory check/doctor lint warnings for missing manifest command executables
  and project script paths
- manifest-declared mise trust/missing-tool checks, `mise install`, and
  `mise run` delegation; no `mise bootstrap` integration
- bundled declarative artifact registry for Base-managed built-in artifacts
- explicit uv-managed Python project setup through `python.manager: uv`
- explicit `repo init --language` profiles with normalized
  `project.languages` metadata and Python uv opt-in
- project Python runtime requirements through `python.requires_python`
- shell-only setup/check/doctor routing through the Base-owned runtime without
  a control-plane-only project venv; explicit `python:` and `python-package`
  manifests keep project Python ownership
- cleanup, logs, local command history, and privacy-conscious history reports
- local config inspection
- guided project onboarding and read-only workspace onboarding summaries
- read-only workspace agent briefs with stable JSON readiness signals
- repository baseline creation and checks
- GitHub issue, PR, branch, and worktree helpers
- workspace status/check/doctor/onboarding/agent-brief/init/clone/pull/configure flows
- release readiness inspection and guarded GitHub release publishing
- stable v1 JSON envelopes for repo, release, issue-readiness, and stale-branch
  inspection surfaces
- local AI context export bundles
- repo-owned prompt rendering through `basectl prompt`
- documentation entrypoint opening through `basectl docs`
- explicit `ai` prerequisite profile for Codex CLI and Claude Code
- explicit `linux-lab` prerequisite profile for host-side Multipass checks and
  setup
- Ubuntu/Debian runtime checks, diagnostics, and source-checkout validation

Recent trust and workspace updates are part of the current implementation:

- repository secret scanning and provider push protection are enforced, with a
  checksum-pinned Gitleaks history scan covering generic patterns
- project-originated IDE mutations require explicit
  `--allow-project-ide-mutations` consent; `--yes` alone does not authorize
  those changes
- `basectl gh branch prune` and `basectl gh worktree prune` accept opt-in
  `--closed-unmerged` handling for clean branches and worktrees tied to closed,
  unmerged pull requests
- `basectl workspace status --format json` includes a top-level aggregate
  status using the existing `error`, `warn`, and `ok` precedence

## Active Development Direction

The `v1.8.0` release is complete. Future work is tracked in GitHub Issues,
with GitHub CLI install/auth polish for Ubuntu, Docker/service artifacts,
broader prompt ergonomics, broader Linux distribution support, and broader
setup policy work remaining outside the shipped 1.8.0 release contract.

The accepted product position is now a local operating contract for
deterministic readiness and handoff within a project, from a single repository
to a multi-repository workspace. `workspace agent-brief` summarizes local
repository readiness, while onboarding, diagnostics, history reports, and
context exports provide deeper handoff evidence. The issue-oriented artifact in
#1562 remains planned.
No adapter or manifest import is shipped for `mani`, `gita`, `vcs2l`, Android
Repo, or `west`; those integration ideas remain proposals.

The Homebrew bottle and consumer upgrade contract has passed the #526 rehearsal.
Supported macOS installs should continue to use bottled Homebrew packages, with
source builds treated as fallback validation rather than the normal user path.

Recent released work includes:

- Ubuntu/Debian runtime support through `BASE_PLATFORM=linux-debian`,
  platform-aware setup/check/doctor dispatch, source-checkout CI coverage,
  apt-backed setup behind explicit `--dry-run` / `--yes` confirmation, and
  policy-governed uv/mise CLI bootstrap with explicit consent and optional
  managed checksum verification
- targeted `bootstrap.sh --ensure-bash` support for Mac and Ubuntu/Debian Bash
  4.2+ repair before the normal `basectl setup` path can run
- `basectl docs` for opening the GitHub README documentation entrypoint
- standardized `basectl` help, option, logging, and usage-error behavior
- Python-backed CI setup JSON rendering and Project issue-default handling
- release-publish recovery guidance and release title validation
- optional pinned Homebrew installer support for verified bootstrap sources
- shell and completion performance improvements for project-name and Git prompt
  rendering
- redaction hardening for config display and setup command logs
- normalized Bash source guards and explicit `base-test` error handling
- local command-history index with privacy-conscious text, Markdown, and JSON
  report surfaces
- project Python version requirements for Base-managed virtualenv creation
- workspace manifest status/check/doctor reporting, read-only onboarding summaries,
  and explicit init, clone, pull, and configure support
- guarded `basectl release publish`
- release check, plan, and notes commands
- local `.ai-context/` export bundles through `basectl export-context`
- newcomer orientation presentation docs
- optional project Git remote reachability diagnostics
- explicit `ai` prerequisite profile
- explicit host-scoped `linux-lab` prerequisite profile for Multipass checks
  and setup
- portable project Git workflow guidance from `basectl repo init`
- Homebrew upgrade path preservation for explicit `BASE_HOME` and shell startup
  snippets
- stale readonly `BASE_HOME` recovery guidance after Homebrew upgrades
- Homebrew Command Line Tools staleness warnings in `basectl check`
- Homebrew `basectl update` handoff and package-aware `basectl test base`
- Base `1.0.1` AGPL license cleanup and release artifacts
- explicit uv-managed Python setup and command runner support
- bundled `lib/base/artifact-registry.yaml` support for built-in artifacts
- workspace-aware repo clone, manifest-driven workspace clone, Project intake
  workflow generation, and resilient `basectl gh` command execution
- external `base-bash-libs` consumption for reusable Bash libraries, with Base
  retaining only Bash runtime and version helpers
- documented `base-bash-libs` Homebrew/core readiness as the future standalone
  dependency for a non-conflicting `basefoundry` core formula
- documented that `basectl setup` should stay serial for mutating installers
  until a deterministic setup-plan/preflight layer exists
