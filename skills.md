This file documents repeatable AI-assisted development workflows for Base.
Coding standards live in `STANDARDS.md`.

## GitHub Issue And PR Workflow

Use this workflow when creating GitHub issues, branches, worktrees, or pull
requests for Base.

- Prefer `basectl gh` for supported Base repository GitHub workflows so Base
  dogfoods its own issue, branch, PR, and repository hygiene tool.
- Fall back to the GitHub connector, raw `gh`, or `git` when `basectl gh` does
  not support the needed operation or local `gh` authentication/tooling is not
  available.
- Assign Codex-created issues to `codeforester`.
- Use GitHub default-style labels:
  - `bug` for defects.
  - `enhancement` for features, refactors, and most maintenance.
  - `documentation` for docs-only changes.
  - `ci` for GitHub Actions, tests, and release automation.
  - `security` for hardening, dependency pinning, and static analysis.
- Do not create new `type:*` labels.
- Name branches as `<category>/<issue>-<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>`, for example
  `bug/245-20260529-fix-profile-project-prompt`. The category prefix must match
  the issue's single standard category label.
- Do not use provider-specific alternatives such as `feat/`, `agent/`,
  `codex/`, or a bare `<issue>-<slug>` branch. The same server-side rule applies
  to every AI tool and human contributor.
- Do all pull request implementation work in a dedicated worktree under
  `~/work/base-worktrees/<slug>`.
- Before creating a worktree, check whether the current checkout is already a
  linked worktree for the issue. Do not create nested or duplicate worktrees.
- Keep the PR worktree available while review feedback is pending. After merge,
  sync `main`, remove the worktree, and delete local and remote branches.
- Link PRs to issues with `Fixes #<issue>` or `Closes #<issue>`.
- See `docs/github-workflow.md` for the full policy, including milestones and
  GitHub Projects.

## Close a superseded pull request

Use this workflow when a pull request will not merge because another pull
request carries its implementation. Treat the close decision and branch
cleanup as one operation for every AI tool and human contributor:

- verify that the replacement pull request contains the superseded work;
- add a closing comment linking the replacement pull request;
- close the superseded pull request and delete its remote head branch;
- remove agent-created local branches and worktrees, then verify cleanup;
- preserve user-owned or dirty worktrees unless the user explicitly approves
  their removal; and
- keep ownership of any failed cleanup instead of making it a user follow-up.

Do not apply this cleanup to an ordinary closed pull request without an
established replacement. See `docs/github-workflow.md` for the detailed close,
delete, and verification procedure.

## Debug and verify Base behavior

Use this workflow when investigating failed Base commands, broken setup/check/
doctor output, failed builds, project discovery surprises, runtime shell drift,
or CI failures.

- Read the full error output first, including stack traces, command output,
  finding IDs, and paths.
- Reproduce the symptom from a clean command line before fixing it. If the
  issue is not reproducible, gather more evidence instead of guessing.
- Check recent changes with `git status`, `git diff`, and relevant commit or PR
  context.
- Trace the bad value or failed state to its source. For cross-layer failures,
  inspect each boundary separately: public launcher, Bash command, Python
  helper, manifest parser, project command, environment variables, and working
  directory.
- Form one hypothesis, make the smallest change that tests it, and rerun the
  focused verification. Do not stack unrelated fixes.
- Keep `basectl check` and `basectl doctor` non-mutating. They should diagnose
  readiness, not repair local state.
- Before claiming completion, run the command that proves the claim in the
  current checkout or worktree and read the output. Report the command and the
  result in the PR and final summary.

For example, a `basectl doctor` bug should usually have both a focused unit
test around the finding logic and a smoke test that exercises the command or
Python entry point that emits the finding.

## Change behavior, fix bugs, or handle review feedback

Use this workflow when changing user-facing Base behavior, shared runtime
behavior, command output, JSON contracts, doctor findings, setup logic, or
public workflow docs.

- Start bug fixes with a failing test, fixture, or reproduction whenever
  practical. Prove it fails for the expected reason before relying on it.
- Keep test scope proportional to risk: focused BATS or pytest first, then
  `basectl test base` or integration checks when shared behavior is touched.
- When an automated test is not practical, document the manual reproduction and
  verification command clearly.
- For docs-only or configuration-only changes, `git diff --check` is usually
  enough unless the change affects CI validation or generated output.
- Evaluate review feedback against Base's product boundaries before
  implementing it. Base is the local operating contract for deterministic
  readiness and handoff; project-specific application behavior belongs in the
  owning project.
- If feedback suggests a larger design or product shift, stop and surface the
  decision instead of hiding it inside a small PR.

## Add or revise a Base agent workflow

Use this workflow when adding or changing reusable AI-assisted development
guidance such as this `skills.md` file, `AGENTS.md`, or workflow documentation.

- Put durable repo-local rules in `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `STANDARDS.md`, `skills.md`, or focused docs. Do not add personal Codex
  runtime settings to the repo.
- Prefer trigger-focused workflow names and descriptions. The first lines
  should make it clear when the workflow applies.
- Keep entries concise and Base-specific. Link to focused docs for longer
  policy instead of duplicating it.
- Align examples with Base conventions: `basectl gh`, `origin/main`,
  `<category>/<issue>-<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>`, and
  `~/work/base-worktrees/<slug>`.
- Review the workflow against likely pressure cases: time pressure, ambiguous
  review feedback, failing tests, dirty worktrees, and temptation to broaden
  Base beyond the workspace control-plane boundary.
- Validate documentation-only workflow changes with `git diff --check`. If a
  CI workflow validates the guidance, run or update that validation too.

## Add a basectl subcommand

Use this workflow when adding or changing a `basectl <command>` feature.

- Public entrypoint: `bin/basectl`
- Command implementation: `cli/bash/commands/basectl/`
- Subcommands: `cli/bash/commands/basectl/subcommands/`
- Tests: `cli/bash/commands/basectl/tests/`
- Update completions: `lib/shell/completions/basectl_completion.sh` and
  `lib/shell/completions/basectl_completion.zsh` — add the new command to the
  top-level command list, add a case block for its options, and keep changed
  flags synchronized.
- Follow shell standards in `STANDARDS.md`.
- Validate focused command behavior with:

```bash
bats cli/bash/commands/basectl/tests/help.bats
bats cli/bash/commands/basectl/tests/setup.bats
```

Swap `setup.bats` for the focused subcommand test file you changed.

## Add a Bash command

Use this workflow when adding a public Base-owned Bash command.

- Add the public launcher under `bin/`.
- Put implementation code under `cli/bash/commands/<command>/`.
- Keep command tests under `cli/bash/commands/<command>/tests/`.
- Prefer a launcher that delegates through `basectl` so the Base runtime owns
  path setup and library loading.
- Add or update the command README when user-facing behavior changes.

## Add a Bash library

Use this workflow when adding shared Bash behavior.

- Library path: `lib/bash/<name>/lib_<name>.sh`
- Module README: `lib/bash/<name>/README.md`
- Tests: `lib/bash/<name>/tests/`
- Use `import_base_lib` from Base runtime scripts.
- Do not use `set -e`; use explicit error handling.
- Validate the module's BATS tests directly before running the broader suite.

## Add a Python CLI feature

Use this workflow when adding or changing Python-backed Base behavior.

- Shared framework: `lib/python/base_cli/`
- Command packages: `cli/python/`
- Command execution wrapper: `bin/base-wrapper`
- Keep package tests next to the package under `tests/`.
- Run Python commands with `PYTHONPATH=lib/python:cli/python`.
- Validate with:

```bash
env PYTHONPATH=lib/python:cli/python python -m pytest
```

## Add or change artifact setup

Use this workflow when changing `base_manifest.yaml`, default artifacts, or
setup behavior.

- Project manifest: `base_manifest.yaml`
- Default artifacts: `lib/base/default_manifest.yaml`
- Development artifacts: `lib/base/dev_manifest.yaml`
- Artifact registry: `cli/python/base_setup/registry.py`
- Prefer delegation to mature tools over expanding Base-owned setup logic.
- Keep `basectl check` and `basectl doctor` non-mutating.
- Include `tests/install.bats` when installer behavior or setup bootstrap
  behavior changes.

## Change shell startup behavior

Use this workflow when changing profile, rc, completion, or activation behavior.

- Startup snippets: `lib/shell/`
- Runtime shell entrypoint: `lib/bash/runtime/bashrc`
- Profile updater: `cli/bash/commands/basectl/subcommands/update_profile.sh`
- Managed login and interactive snippets must not source `base_init.sh`.
- Validate startup behavior with:

```bash
bats lib/bash/runtime/tests/runtime_bashrc.bats
bats cli/bash/commands/basectl/tests/setup.bats
```

## Release or Homebrew-facing changes

Use this workflow when changing installation, update, or public package
behavior.

- Standalone installer: `install.sh`
- User-facing install test coverage: `tests/install.bats`
- Homebrew tap repository: `https://github.com/basefoundry/homebrew-base`
- User-facing Homebrew install command: `brew install basefoundry/base/base`
- Keep Homebrew users on `brew upgrade basefoundry/base/base` rather than
  `basectl update`.
- Validate with:

```bash
bats tests/install.bats
bin/basectl check
bin/basectl setup --dry-run
```
